    <p>New line.</p>

    <p>
      This is a new line added to 'main' AFTER creating the 'bone-bread' branch 
    </p>

    <h3>
      This line is in the working copy from main, just before switching to 'bone-bread'
    </h3>

  <p>Our bread now uses 25% less chalk!</p>

  <p>Our bone bread is NOT perfectly safe. Please do not keep contacting us about the bone taste of our bread.</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    Bone bread is a rich source of calcium!!
    
    This addidition should not cause a conflict when merged with main.
